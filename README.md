## Description

[Deployed app on heroku](https://restful-to-graphql.herokuapp.com/)

-RESTful API is the standard but this method can easily overfetch. I refactored a RESTful API to GraphQL API to cut down the amount that is fetched for this app. This way only what is being searched is being fetched instead of all the possible books within this Google Books API. This change to GraphQL makes the app quicker to load, lighter, and overall improves the functionality of the app.
